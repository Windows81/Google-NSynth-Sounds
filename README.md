# Google-NSynth-Sounds
Archive of sounds saved on ["NSynth: Sound Maker"](https://g.co/soundmaker), converted to OGG. Unlike [the original project's sounds](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-sound-maker/tree/master/sounds), soundfonts exist, and the audio is trimmed using FFMPEG.  This is adequate for music production.
